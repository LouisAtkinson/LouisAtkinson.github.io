            <div id="abouttext">Previously a freelance musician and teacher, I discovered a passion for web developing. Using The Odin Project as my primary learning source, I have become proficient in the languages and technologies listed in the skills section. You can see these use in the 'Projects' section. 
                <br><br> I love the problem-solving challenges that appear during programming, and always enjoy developing my skills as I find solutions to these problems. I am excited to continue expanding my skillset as a developer, and you will find these new skills showcased in my projects.
                <br><br> Outside of programming, I am a big chess fan (for many of the same reasons I enjoy programming!), and continue to study music in my free time, uploading jazz solo transcriptions on my YouTube channel.
